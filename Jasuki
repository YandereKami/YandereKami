- I’m @YandereKami
- I’m interested in drawing, digital or mechanical, graphic design, animation etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently attempting to become above average in proficiency in every drawing application out there, I already have Photoshop, Clip Studio. Sai, and Krita down. I need to get myself a newer Ipad so that I can finally complete my goal and master Procreate as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, I'm too busy with commissions and my own side ambitions.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Idk, here I guess if it even allows you to message? If not I occasionally check my Twitter.
